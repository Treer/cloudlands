Construction requires 14 blocks of ancient portalstone. We have no knowledge of how portalstones were created, the means to craft them are likely lost to time, so our only source has been to scavenge the Nether for the remnants of ancient broken portals. A finished frame is four blocks wide, five blocks high, and stands vertically, like a doorway.=

The only portal we managed to scavenge enough portalstone to build took us to a land of floating islands. There were hills and forests and even water up there, but the edges are a perilous drop â€” a depth of which we cannot even begin to plumb.=
